# Design Log Rules

## Structure
- Create numbered files: `001-feature-name.md`, `002-feature-name.md`
- Start with title, date, and status (Planning/Implemented/Deprecated)

## Content
- **Before building:** Document the plan, ask clarifying questions with options (A/B/C)
- **After building:** Add "Implementation Notes & Lessons Learned" section
- Mark selected options with ✅ **SELECTED** — don't remove other options

## Lessons Learned Section
Document:
- Issues encountered and solutions
- Architecture decisions and tradeoffs
- Future improvements (as checklist)

## Keep Updated
- Update status when implementation completes
- Add notes whenever bugs are fixed or behavior changes
